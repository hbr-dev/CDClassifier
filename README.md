# CDClassifier
This project aims to classify images of cats and dogs using a convolutional neural network built with TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras. The objective is to achieve at least 63% accuracy in distinguishing between the two classes. The model will be trained on a labeled dataset,learning to recognize features and patterns for effective image classification.
