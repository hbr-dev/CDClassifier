# 🐶🐱 Cat vs. Dog Image Classification

## 📖 Overview
This project focuses on classifying images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of at least 63% in distinguishing between these two popular pet classes. By training the model on a labeled dataset of images, it learns to recognize distinct features and patterns, enabling effective image classification.

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Convolutional Neural Network:** Utilizes CNN architecture to effectively learn and classify images.
- **TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras:** Leverages powerful libraries for building and training deep learning models.
- **Image Preprocessing:** Implements techniques to prepare and augment images for improved model performance.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluates model accuracy and loss during training and testing phases.

## 📊 Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing labeled images of cats and dogs. This dataset is crucial for training and validating the CNN model.

### Dataset File
- `train.zip`: Contains training images of cats and dogs.
- `test.zip`: Contains test images for evaluating model performance.
